% Balancing columns in a ref list is a bit of a pain because you
% either use a hack like flushend or balance, or manually insert
% a column break.  http://www.tex.ac.uk/cgi-bin/texfaq2html?label=balance
% multicols doesn't work because we're already in two-column mode,
% and flushend isn't awesome, so I choose balance.  See this
% for more info: http://cs.brown.edu/system/software/latex/doc/balance.pdf
%
% Note that in a perfect world balance wants to be in the first
% column of the last page.
%
% If balance doesn't work for you, you can remove that and
% hard-code a column break into the bbl file right before you
% submit:
%
% http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2149854/how-to-manually-equalize-columns-
% in-an-ieee-paper-if-using-bibtex
%
% Or, just remove \balance and give up on balancing the last page.
